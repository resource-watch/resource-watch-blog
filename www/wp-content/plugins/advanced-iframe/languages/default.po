"     One advantage of the iframe communcation is that by default you see the callbacks to height.html in the network. So is was always easy to debug out of the box. window.postMessage by default is not visible like that. If you have any problems with window.postMessage select \"Debug\" at \"Use postMessage communication\" and log information about the transfered data is printed to the browser console. Use F12 at your browser to open the developer tools. \n"

"      <h3>What are jQuery selectors?</h3>\n"
"      <p>\n"
"      jQuery selectors are one of the most important aspects of the jQuery library. These selectors use familiar CSS syntax to allow page authors to quickly and easily identify any set of page elements to operate upon with the jQuery library methods. Understanding jQuery selectors is the key to using the jQuery library most effectively. The selector is a string expression that identifies the set of DOM elements that will be collected into a matched set to be operated upon by the jQuery methods.\n"
"      </p>\n"
"           <h3>Types of jQuery selectors?</h3>\n"
"      <p>\n"
"        There are three categories of jQuery selectors: Basic CSS selectors, Positional selectors, and Custom jQuery selectors.\n"
"      </p><p>\n"
"The Basic Selectors are known as \"find selectors\" as they are used to find elements within the DOM. The Positional and Custom Selectors are \"filter selectors\" as they filter a set of elements (which defaults to the entire set of elements in the DOM). This extract will focus on the basic selectors as they are most important and will cover most of your needs.\n"
"      </p>\n"
"\n"
"      <h4>Basic CSS Selectors</h4>\n"
"      <p>These selectors follow standard CSS3 syntax and semantics. For more selectors and examples go to <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors\" target=\"_blank\">http://api.jquery.com//category/selectors</a>.</p>\n"

You only need to specify the id of the element you want to show with the parameter ?ai-show-id-only=id. If you only specify this parameter the whole page is loaded and then with Javascript all other elements are hidden.

By default overflow (scrolling) is hidden inside the iframe. If you like that scrollbars are shown if needed add &ai-show-overflow=1 to the url. Also check \"Add ai_external.js local\" as this actually the even more powerfull solution but more complicated to setup. So try what fits best to your needs!

msgid "Elements that are hidden with display:none return a size of 0 when the height is measured. This is very often the case when tabs are used and you place an iframe on a tab that is not shown by default. The next settings are needed for a workaround that moves the hidden element out of the viewport, shows and measures the iframe and moves everything back. To get this working you need to provide the id or class of the tab that is hidden and depending on the tabs plugin also the id or class of the tab that is visible by default to get the correct width. Please read the section \"<a class=\"howto-id-link\" href=\"#\">How to find the id and the attributes</a>\" to find the right id or class. E.g. Tabby Responsive Tabs and Post UI Tabs work fine with this solution. Even nested tabs do work! If you need a custom solution please contact me for an offer."

As the tab is hidden this should not be a problem. For details please see the \"<a id=\"external-workaround-link\" href=\"#xss\">External workaround</a>\"."
