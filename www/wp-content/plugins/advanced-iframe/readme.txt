= Main features of advanced iframe =
By entering the shortcode '[advanced_iframe]' you can include any webpage to any page or article. 
The following cool features compared to a normal iframe are implemented:

- Security code: You can only insert the shortcode with a valid security code from the administration.
- Hide areas of the layout to give the iframe more space (see screenshot) 
- Show only specific areas of the iframe when the iframe is on a same domain (The Pro version supports this on different domains) or include parts directly by jQuery
- Modify css styles in the parent and the iframe to e.g. change the width of the content area (see screenshot)
- Forward parameters to the iframe 
- Resize the iframe to the content height or width on loading, AJAX or click 
- Scroll the parent to the top when the iframe is loaded
- Hide the content until it is fully loaded 
- Add a css and js file to the parent page
- Many additional cool features are available the pro version - see http://www.tinywebgallery.com/blog/advanced-iframe/advanced-iframe-comparison-chart 

Please note: Modification inside the iframe are only possible if you are on the same domain or use a workaround like described in the settings.

So please check first if the iframe page and the parent page are one the same domain. www.example.com and text.example.com are different domains! Please check in the documentation if you can use the feature you like

A free iframe checker is available at 
http://www.tinywebgallery.com/blog/advanced-iframe/free-iframe-checker.
This tool does check if a page is allowed to be included! 

All settings can be set with shortcode attributes as well. If you only use one iframe please use the settings in the administration because there each parameter is explained in detail and also the defaults are set there.

= Administration =  
* Go to Settings -> Advanced iFrame

=	Quick start guide =
The quickstart guide is also available as video: http://www.tinywebgallery.com/blog/advanced-iframe/advanced-iframe-video-tutorials 

To include a webpage to your page please check the following things first:

*	Check if your page page is allowed to be included http://www.tinywebgallery.com/blog/advanced-iframe/free-iframe-checker!
* Check if the iframe page and the parent page are one the same domain. www.example.com and text.example.com are different domains!
* Can you modify the page that should be included?

Most likely you have one of the following setups:

1.	iframe cannot be included:  You cannot include the content because the owner does not allow this. 
1.	iframe can be included and you are on a different domain: See the feature comparison chart: http://www.tinywebgallery.com/blog/advanced-iframe/advanced-iframe-comparison-chart and the feature overview http://www.tinywebgallery.com/blog/advanced-iframe/advanced-iframe-features-availability-overview. To resize the content to the height/width or modify css you need to modify the remote iframe page by adding one line of Javascript to enable the provided workaround.
1.  iframe can be included and you are on the same domain: All features of the plugin can be used. 

If you mix http and https read http://www.tinywebgallery.com/blog/iframe-do-not-mix-http-and-https. Parent https and iframe http does not work on all mayor browsers!

== Changelog ==
= 7.5.4 =
- New: The security key is now optional. You can still set if like before in the administration and the behavoir is exactly like before. But many users told me they don't need it and therefore I made it optinoal now by default. 
- New: The view limit of the free version does now not make the iframe stop but is showing a powered by message below the iframe.   
- New: If $add_iframe_url_as_param is set then $map_parameter_to_url is set to "page" by default if not set differently in the config.
- New: Better documentation of the resize on the same domain. resize_min_height is now documented there with possible alternate solutions if is does not work.
- New: All js files where checked with jshint and all errors/warnings where removed. So now if you open the files in the Wordpress editor you should not get any complaints anymore.
- New: The automatic check of the url can be enabled/disabled now. When the load of the administration does fail it is autmatically disabled now because otherwise the administration screen could be white. 
- New: The save checks when you save a post or page can now be configured. You can disable it, show only errors or errors and warnings. Default is now error.
- New: ai_post_message_converter.js is now iframe id dependant. This makes it possible to have different post messages on the same installation at the same time. the naming is now: ai_post_message_converter_<id>.js. You can still use ai_post_message_converter.js which applies for all iframes then.
- New: Added the documentation for the BBCode [advanced_iframe]url[/advanced_iframe]. This was only documented in the FAQ.
- Fix: The normal show iframe (without any header/footer) as layer was always 100% instead of 96%. This was because of a change in 7.5.2 and is now fixed.   
- Fix: ai_post_message_converter_template.js was not working properly as event.data can not be overwritten. Now the converter does return a new modified object which is used after that.
- Fix: In the iframe tag ' was used for all attributes. This is now replaced with " where every possible. Only the onload='' attribute uses still the single quote because double quotes are used a lot inside. This enhanced the compability with WpRocket
- Fix: A Javascript error in aiAutoZoomExternal was fixed. This caused the feature "auto zoom by ratio" to fail. This now works fine again. 
- Fix: allowfullscreen was only enabled in the pro version but it should be available in the free version. Now this is the case.
= 7.5.3 =
Fix: An error in ai_external.js was fixed which prevented the external workaround to work with postMessage and debug log enabled.
= 7.5.2 =
- New: Provide parts of your website to other domains with "Enable content filter". This new feature does actually not provide an iframe but you can offer parts of your website identified by an id in an external iframe with additional auto height. The content can be clipped on the server and on the client depending on your setup. See http://www.tinywebgallery.com/blog/advanced-iframe/advanced-iframe-pro-demo/share-content-from-your-domain-content-filter
- New: Provide parts of your website to other domains with "Add ai_external.js local". The setting does add the ai_external.js to your own site. This enables you to provide parts of your site into an external iframe. This is simelar to "enable_content_filter" where you can filter parts of your page. The advantage of this solution is that you can use all css modifications and auto height of this solution. See http://www.tinywebgallery.com/blog/advanced-iframe/advanced-iframe-pro-demo/share-content-from-your-domain-add-ai_external-js-local  
- New: Internal JS debug console: debug_js. You can redirect the Javascript console log to a visible div. The pro version also supports the external workaround. This is very useful if you have errors only on e.g. an ipad where accessing this info is very hard. Also the user agent and the full headers from the iframe are displayed there! See http://www.tinywebgallery.com/blog/advanced-iframe/advanced-iframe-pro-demo/debug-javascript-example
- New: The free iframe checker is included at the url field in the administration. So you can do a basic check already there.
- New: Each iframe url is now checked when you save a post! As many users seems not to use the free iframe checker, the checker is now included there as well. 
- New: All iframes on your site can be checked by a single click. Simply check "Check all iframes" at Url on the basic tab.
- New: All iframes on your site can be checked by a cronjob. So once a day a status e-mail is sent to the e-mail you provide. Please read the instructions on the options tab because maybe you need to switch to native cronjobs if you have many iframes because of performance reasons. 
- New: "hide parts of the iframe" does now support semi transparent backgrounds. So rgba(1,1,1,0.5) does work. But , has to be replaced by ;. So rgba(1;1;1;0.5) is the format you need to use.
- New: "hide parts of the iframe" supports that divs can be removed by a click again with adding $hide after the color.
- New: "hide parts of the iframe" supports that divs can be removed automatically  after a specified time with adding $hide3000 after the color. So after hide you add the time in ms.
- New: The delay of the resize of the external workaround does now also delay the init of the resize to element resize. This solves the problem if elements are loaded dynamically. 
- New: vh and vw are now offically supported. See https://caniuse.com/#feat=viewport-units
- New: html title is now supported.
- New: jquery-lazyload-any was updated to v0.3.1. Also "Script Style" is now used instead of "Comment Style". This has now the big advantage that lazy load still works even if tools which do optimize the html by removing comments. So it is now compatible with e.g. wp rocket. 
- New: iframe_redirect_url does now also check if the page is included by the domain specified. Otherwise it is redirected to the iframe_redirect_url. This way you can make sure that the iframe page can only be included by your domain. This solution depends on Javascript and also that a referrer is sent to the iframe. But this is no 100% protection because you can fake the referer on some setups with a javascript location redirect (See https://stackoverflow.com/a/30304058) and if you disable Javascript with a sandbox. So please add a css with html { visibility:hidden; } to the page in the iframe. This does hide the page by default for everyone. The ai_external.js does then make the page visible again! If no referer is found the iframe_redirect_url will be used always if the page is in an iframe.  
- New: Wrong configurations of 'resize to element resize' is detected now and is logged to the console. A try catch was added to handle this problem properly.
- Fix: The resize in the external workaround does now reset the resize delay at is does not makes sense here. 
- Fix: The resize later wat not not updating  the last height. So resize later stopped working at some configurations.

= 7.5.1 =
- New: $onload_scroll_top does now support "iframe" as setting. The page does then scroll to the top of the iframe and not of the page.
- New: The delay of the resize of the external workaround does now also delay the modification of the css as most of the time the elements that should be modified also are then also loaded dynamically (Pro) 
- New: Improved the documentation of change link targets that also forms can be changed!
- Fix: Not all IE versions (<= 11) do support default method values. So e.g. even auto height does fail! This was introduced in version 7.5. So please update if you use 7.5!  Now the code is rewritten to support older IE versions as well.  
- Fix: The resize delay in the external workaround does not try to measure height and width before the delay anymore which can lead to wrong messages in the js console. (Pro) 
- Fix: The resize delay in the external workaround is now added to the first resize on element resize call. (Pro) 
- Fix: AUTH_KEY is now set to AUTH_KEY_MISSING if it is not set in wp-config
- Fix: In the standalone version the browser detection a wordpress function was used that was not mapped. Now the normal php function Worppress also uses is used. (Pro)
= 7.5 =
- New: Added nice icons to the menu and the editor button
- New: The editor button does now support ALL settings. By default this is now securitykey,src,width,height.
- New: Show iframe in layer can now unload the iframe when closed. So e.g.music does stop then. If not unloaded it is now not loaded again! Before it was nut unloaded but on reopen loaded again! See show_iframe_as_layer_keep_content. Default is true (Pro) 
- New: Show iframe as layer does now support the loading icon (Pro)
- New: Show iframe as layer does now support "hide content until loaded"  (Pro)
- New: Show iframe as layer background has now a pointer to make clear that the layer closes if clicked. 
- New: parent_content_css was added for the pro version. This gives you additional options when you modify the parent and you don't want to create an external css file for this!
- New: If element_to_measure cannot be found we show an error message in the console log. 
- New: If resize_on_element_resize cannot be found we show an error message in the console log. 
- New: Improved quickstart guide and improved documentation on the basic tab.
- New: The shortcode generator is now available for the free version also. 
- New: standalone version js was upgraded to 7.5 as well. (Pro)
- New: Browscap version 6023 lite 04 May 2017 is now included. (Pro)  
- New: A modified version of php-browser-detection 3.2 is now used which does now also auto update browsecap.ini. Also os (operating system) can now be used. Like Linux, Android, Win7, Win8, WIN10 .... 
- New: "Show part of an iframe" also supports media queries for the basic setup. Demo 55 shows how this works.                                           
- New: Added an additional hint to use the external workaround if auto height with the same domain does not work. 
- New: Unique class for each viewport. This also enables to e.g. enable scrollbars, media queries... to other viewports. See example 3 http://www.tinywebgallery.com/blog/advanced-iframe/advanced-iframe-pro-demo/show-only-a-part-of-the-iframe#e3
- New: Improved the add_iframe_url_as_param_prefix setting. Additional checks was added for https. So switching from http to https and using the old bookmarks without the s| still works.  
- New: Add to docu that inactive for the editor is o.k. and if is does not work create/edit the files manually
- New: include_scripts_in_content=true. This is only needed in the special case if you use the page with content only (like using the plugin "Show Content Only" with "Content + Styles" mode). Then ai.js is directly rendered before the iframe. See demo <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tinywebgallery.com/blog/advanced-iframe/demo-advanced-iframe-2-0/same-domain-wrapped-auto-height">wrapped auto height</a>
- New: Support for Wordpress 4.8.1
- Fix: Chrome is now detected by the browser detection again.
- Fix: Viewports in "Show only a part of the iframe" where not working because of a change in 7.4.1. Now it works fine again. 
- Fix: resize_on_ajax_jquery was set to false as default if disabled and not to true. This causes that in the shortcode generator was always showing  resize_on_ajax_jquery="false" 
- Fix: The resize script was included in 7.4.2 to ai_external.js directly. The dead code that was adding the script dynamically to ai_external.js was removed.
- Fix: In expert mode the src is now also hidden completely. 
- Fix: Invalid settings for dataPostMessage are now detected and printed to the log.
- Fix: Documentation of debugPostMessage, usePostMessage, additional_css_file_iframe was added/fixed
= 7.4.3 =
- Fix: iframe_redirect_url was brocken in 7.4.2 because of a missing ). 

= 7.4.2 = 
- New: The resize script is now direclty added to the ai_external.js. Chrome does show a warning now if js files are loaded internaly with document.write and this is now not done anymore. Also make sure you load jQuery manually in your pages as ai_external.js does also load jQery this way! 
- New: iframe_redirect_url does now support that only in case no ? is found in the iframe_redirect_url the parameters of the iframe are added again.

- New: Support for Wordpress 4.7.4
- Fix: window.location.search was addd with a ? too much to iframe_redirect_url 
- Fix: a couple of settings where not enabled/disabled properly when main elements where toggled. Now also the defaults are set properly everywhere.

= 7.4.1 =
- New: Documentation for ai_config_switcher_template was added to the "external workaround" tab.
- New: Resize on element resize does also trigger the modification of the iframe again. This makes is possible that stuff loaded by e.g. ajax can also be changed!
- New: "Show only a part of the iframe" css settings for the iframe do now use !important at the styles for the iframe to make sure that iframe settings e.g. from the theme like iframe { width:100%; } or other plugins that try to resize iframes dynamically will not kill this feature
- New: z-index for iframe in a layer was increased to 100001-100003 to stay over the wp-admin bar!
- New: iframe in layer background layer is now inserted at a different location in the dom to support more themes.
- New: Support for Wordpress 4.7.3
- New: Standalone version was updated to the lastest version + postMessage is now default there too.
- Fix: Edit/view of files in the custom folder was not working anymore because of a WP change. Now this works again. The editor shows (inactive) as this files are in a folder with no active plugin directly.
- Fix: Added missing px settings at a css style for "Show only a part of the iframe" 
- Fix: iframe in a layer backgroud div is now added to a diffent position in the dom to be more flexible with other themes tha also defines z-indexes. 

= 7.4 =
- New: New installations get postMessage communication as default as only 0.2% of all used browsers (IE <= 8) do not support this! When the project was started this was almost 20%!
- New: Improved documentation of the external workaround tab.
- New: "Hide part of an iframe" is now also included to the area selector. 
- New: "Hide part of an iframe" has now an extra section in the config.
- New: If we have a wrapper div we set this as default element to measure. This avoids problems if dynamically other elements are added by other scripts!
- New: default element can be set on the external workaround tab and not only before the ai_external.js
- New: Warning is shown in the log if the element cannot be measured
- New: Add better support for element to measure -> getbyid -> jQuery...
- New: Warning is shown when id starts with a number
- New: Seems some seo tools do render the shortcode in the administration. This can cause that the whole administration is hidden if hide_content_until_iframe_color is set. Therefore  if wp-admin is found in the url the following parameters are disabled: hide_page_until_loaded, hide_page_until_loaded_external=,hide_content_until_iframe_color to avoid this problem.
- New: New help section postMessage comunication vs. iframe 
- Fix: The reserved words link in URL forward parameters is now working
- Fix: add a ; automatically after the style to avoid configuration errors

= 7.4.3 =
- Fix: iframe_redirect_url was brocken in 7.4.2 because of a missing ). 

= 7.3.3 =                  
- New: Support for Wordpress 4.7.4

= 7.3.2 =
- New: Support for Wordpress 4.7.3
- Fix: Edit/view of files in the custom folder was not working anymore because of a WP change. Now this works again. The editor shows (inactive) as this files are in a folder with no active plugin directly.

= 7.3.1 =
- New: Support for Wordpress 4.7

= 7.3 = 
- New: The external workaround post message solution is now using a json structure to transfer the data. This is needed to enable the next feature
- New: You can define elements in the external workaround post message solution that are read from the remote iframe and added a element in the page. This enables you to include content directly if you simply hide the iframe! This is like include content directly with even more power then the one for the same domain! See the examples how cool this works: http://www.tinywebgallery.com/blog/advanced-iframe/advanced-iframe-pro-demo/external-workaround-with-post-message#e52 (Pro)
- New: Support of the external workaround when you include https pages into http pages! See http://www.tinywebgallery.com/blog/advanced-iframe/advanced-iframe-pro-demo/external-workaround-with-post-message#e53 (Pro)
- New: postMessages from non advanced iframe sources can now be used and converted. See ai_post_message_converter_template.js how this works. Enable use_post_message="debug" to check if a remote page does send messages you can use! (Pro)
- New: show_iframe_as_layer_full has a new option: "original". Than the max size of the layer is the given size of the iframe. See http://www.tinywebgallery.com/blog/advanced-iframe/advanced-iframe-pro-demo/show-the-iframe-as-layer#e54 (Pro)

- New: Load a config file depending on a given parameter in the url. see js/ai_config_switcher_template.js and the documentation inside - makes it possible to use one page with different configurations! (Pro)
- New: enable_external_height_workaround has a new state: External. This is now the default as in the ai_external.js auto height is now set to true as most people who use the external workaround use this as default. true does still enable this setting in the ai_external.js but also disables all settings which do not work on the same domain. So if you use several iframes with the external workaround and the same domain you should set this setting to External and set enable_external_height_workaround="true" in the short code for full flexibility. 
- New: A warning is now shown if you use the external workaround without post communication and an https iframe is used in a http page. (Pro)

- Fix: Accordeon menu does now work again. In the next version this will change anyway. I only use this than for the advanced tab as default as this page is simply too big.

= 7.2.1 =
- Fix: sandbox attribute was not use as one file was not commited to the latest build. Now it works fine agian.
- Fix: Zoom and php < 5.3 does not define a needed variable. Now this is defined for older php versions. (Pro)

- Fix: browser detection documentation was wrong: tablets -> tablet (Pro)
- Fix: The hardcoded px was removed at "show only a part of the iframe" show_part_of_iframe_width and show_part_of_iframe_height. If you now specify % e.g. 100% and not 100%px is rendered (but browsers treated 100%px as 100% anyway)

- New: Tab navigation in the administration.
- New: The browser detection is now supporting "browser" and "desktop" also. 
- New: include_html was added which does write the given string directly instead an iframe.

- New: Above the editor a button next to the media button was added to include a basic iframe shortcode. For later versions it is planned that the attributes for the button can be specified in the config.
- New: When zoom is used the browser detection is needed. This does need a lot of memory. A temp file is now created before the check and removed after the check. So if the check does now fail because of a memory crash this file is not deleted and the script does not do the check. You only loose the IE8 support for zoom. The temp file is advanced-iframe-custom/browser-check-failed.txt and if you get mory memory you can remove this file to enable the check again (Pro). 
- New: A message is shown if you include a http iframe to a https page as many major browsers do block this. Therefore it does not make sense to use this setup.

- Fix: The % info text of the area selector was improved. 
- Fix: [ and ] in the security error message where not html encoded. This lead to a strange error message if another plugin is wrapped around and calling do_shortcode. 
- Fix: The max-width for the sourounding div when responsive iframes are enabled where missing a ; which leads to a invalid css value.
- Fix: Added missing links in the documentation at the responsive iframe settings.
- Fix: auto_zoom_by_ratio was missing in the generated shortcode.
